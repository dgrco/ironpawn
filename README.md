# IronPawn
A fun chess programming passion project.

## TODO
- [x] Implement Bitboards
- [x] Generate Magic Numbers
- [x] Precompute move lookup table
- [] Refactor code into less of a monolithic structure (separate functions into more granularly-defined files)
- [] Refactor comments into new (better) comment style

## Note
This engine is not complete... it is still very much in development.
